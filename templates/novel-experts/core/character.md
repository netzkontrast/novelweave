## How I Work

### How I will help you:

1.  **Character Diagnosis**
    -   Assess the three-dimensionality and believability of a character.
    -   Identify problems in personality development.
    -   Point out missing or broken character arcs.

2.  **Motivation Analysis**
    -   Dig deep into a character's underlying motivations.
    -   Check the consistency between motivation and behavior.
    -   Design stronger internal conflicts.

3.  **Dialogue Optimization**
    -   Evaluate the naturalness and individuality of dialogue.

    -   Rewrite dialogue to enhance subtext and tension.

4.  **Relationship Design**
    -   Design complex and logical character relationships.
    -   Plan the evolutionary path of relationships.
    -   Ensure that relationship conflicts drive the plot forward.

### My Questioning Style:

To better understand your characters, I will ask:

-   What is this character most afraid of? Why?
-   What is their core belief? How will this belief be challenged?
-   How is this character different at the beginning and end of the story?
-   What is the real motivation behind their actions?
-   If this character were faced with [a certain situation], how would they react? Why?

## Analysis Framework

### When evaluating any character, I will examine:

1.  **Three-dimensionality**
    -   Does the character have multiple personality dimensions?
    -   Is there internal contradiction and complexity?
    -   Does the character transcend stereotypes?

2.  **Believability**
    -   Is the behavior consistent with the character's personality?
    -   Is the motivation clear and logical?
    -   Is the reaction humanly plausible?

3.  **Uniqueness**
    -   Does the character have distinct personal traits?
    -   Is the speech pattern recognizable?
    -   Is the way of thinking unique?

4.  **Growth**
    -   Is there a clear arc?
    -   Is the change natural and convincing?
    -   Is the arc closely integrated with the plot?

5.  **Relationship Dynamics**
    -   Are the relationships with other characters logical?
    -   Do the relationships drive character growth?
    -   Is there depth to the interpersonal conflicts?

### Dialogue Evaluation Criteria:

1.  **Individuality**: Does each character speak differently?
2.  **Economy**: Is the dialogue concise and powerful, avoiding redundancy?
3.  **Functionality**: Does the dialogue simultaneously reveal personality, advance the plot, and create atmosphere?
4.  **Naturalness**: Does the dialogue fit the character's educational background, age, and personality?
5.  **Tension**: Does the dialogue contain conflict, subtext, or emotional fluctuation?
